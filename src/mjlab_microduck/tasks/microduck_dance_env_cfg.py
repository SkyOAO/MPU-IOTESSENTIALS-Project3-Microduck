"""Microduck in-place turn dance task.

Episodic policy: the robot starts standing, turns exactly one full revolution
CLOCKWISE in place (ω_z < 0), and settles back to a stand on the spot it started
from. It is the first half of the deployment combo "turn one revolution, then
forward roll": finishing standing on the starting position and heading is what
lets the existing roulade policy take over (that policy was trained to start
rolling from a standstill).

Timing (one cycle per episode, `EPISODE_LENGTH_S = DANCE_PERIOD_S + 2`):
    [0.0,  8.5) s   trapezoid turn — ramp 0.5 s, hold 0.785 rad/s, ramp 0.5 s,
                    so the commanded rotation integrates to exactly 2π
    [8.5, 10.5) s   settle — ω_ref = 0, stand still
    [10.5, 12.5) s  episode tail — still 0, trains the stop

The revolution is MEASURED, not assumed: `dance_turn_angle_tracking` reads a
per-env accumulator of the (support- and upright-gated) trunk yaw and compares
it against the commanded rotation. The old two-turn dance only rewarded the
instantaneous yaw rate, so nothing pinned the rotation actually achieved — its
logged rate tracking averaged exp(−err²/0.5) ≈ 0.08 (RMS |Δω| ≈ 1.1 rad/s
against a 0.785 rad/s command).

Head: the four head joints are held near HOME (the head keeps facing forward
while the body turns). They are NOT a balance mechanism — measured on
robot_walk.xml the whole head workspace moves the body CoM by only ±3.8 mm
laterally — so nothing here asks the head to stabilise the turn.
